# Git Tutorial

https://github.com/Gazler/githug

# Clone single branch

 - ``git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>``

## Mirror single branch
- `git clone --bare --single-branch --branch master git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git`
- `git push --mirror git@github.com:<user>/<new-repo>.git`

New repo must exist before you push.
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository  

# Branches

- ```git checkout <branch_name>``` switches to that branch, pulling it down from origin if needed
- ```git checkout -b <branch_name>``` creates and checks out a new branch
- ```git branch``` lists names of local branches

## Check out a branch and create a local working copy against that branch

```
# Check out remote feature branch, such as dev
git checkout dynamic-host-volumes-docs

# Creates the ce805 branch off dynamic-host-volumes-docs. Do your work and then
git checkout -b ce805 dynamic-host-volumes-docs

# update and commit
git commit -am "Your message"

# push local to origin, which should be the existing dynamic-host-volumes-docs branch
git push -u origin ce805
# The -u flag ensures that myFeature is created in our remote repository and linked to our local myFeature branch.
```
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-create-a-branch-from-another-branch/

## Rename

1. Rename your local branch.
If you are on the branch you want to rename: `git branch -m new-name`
If you are on a different branch: `git branch -m old-name new-name`
2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.

   `git push origin :old-name new-name`

3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.
   Switch to the branch and then: `git push origin -u new-name`

## Delete

- ```git branch -d <branch_name>``` The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch
- ``` git branch -D <branch_name>``` You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status."
- ```git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>``` to delete a remote branch
# File
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting

git revert: an operation that takes a specified commit and creates a new commit which inverses the specified commit. git revert can only be run at a commit level scope and has no file level functionality

git checkout:  A file level checkout will change the file's contents to those of the specific commit; discard changes in the working directory

git reset: an operation that takes a specified commit and resets the "three trees" to match the state of the repository at that specified commit. A reset can be invoked in three different modes which correspond to the three trees.



- ```git checkout -- <file>```

# Log
- ```git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"```  ca82a6d - Scott Chacon, 6 years ago : changed the version number
- `git log --oneline`

# Rebase vs Merge

courtesy of Kevin Woo:

* **rebase**: if you are working by yourself and pulling in changes from somewhere (but you ultimately are owning it and just you)
* **merge**: works well with others because you don't rewrite commits that you don't own

If you have a branch branched from another branch instead of master, and you want to update from master:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout matrix/pcm-v1
git merge master
git push
git checkout matrix/pcm-v1-clouddriver
git merge matrix/pcm-v1   <---- merging from this branch because I based off of of matrix/pcm-v1
git push
```

this keeps the history as clean as possible


rebasing is saying "i'm going to override all the existing commits with a new signature so nothing will be easily matched"


another option is just to do:

```bash
git checkout matrix/pcm-v1-clouddriver
git merge master
```
# Cherry Pick

- Cherry pick commit from master into a release branch.
- Make sure origin is up-to-date upstream.

## In master, find the commit you want to cherry pick.
```shell
aimee@aimee-lemur:~/Dev/git/github.com/aimeeu/k8s/sigdocs/website$ git log --oneline
...
82d811354 Fix site build (#16531)
```

```git branch -r``` to see all available branches

## git checkout release branch
```shell
aimee@aimee-lemur:~/Dev/git/github.com/aimeeu/k8s/sigdocs/website$ git checkout origin/release-1.16
Note: checking out 'origin/release-1.16'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 32b0e539a promote AWS-NLB Support from alpha to beta (#14451) (#16459) (#16484)
aimee@aimee-lemur:~/Dev/git/github.com/aimeeu/k8s/sigdocs/website$ git branch

## Create a local branch for changes.
```shell
aimee@aimee-lemur:~/Dev/git/github.com/aimeeu/k8s/sigdocs/website$ git checkout -b aimeeu-1.16-cherrypick-pr16531
Switched to a new branch 'aimeeu-1.16-cherrypick-pr16531'
```

## Cherry pick

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick

Note: using ```git cherry-pick --edit <hash>``` will enable you to edit the commit message
```shell
aimee@aimee-lemur:~/Dev/git/github.com/aimeeu/k8s/sigdocs/website$ git cherry-pick 82d811354 --edit
